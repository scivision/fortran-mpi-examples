# Fortran MPI Examples

[![cmake](https://github.com/scivision/fortran-mpi-examples/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scivision/fortran-mpi-examples/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)
A few very basic examples, perhaps use to test MPI-3 Fortran library functionality.

Free, popular MPI-3 interfaces for C and Fortran include:

* [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) (Linux, Mac)
* [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) (Linux, Mac)
* [Intel MPI](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/mpi-library.html) (Linux, Windows)

Build and self-test:

```sh
cmake --workflow --preset default
```

or step-by-step

```sh
cmake -Bbuild

cmake --build build

ctest --test-dir build -V
```

This repo also gives an example of a workaround for OpenMPI 4.x and mpiexec race condition with large CPU count by setting TMPDIR to a short path name so as not to exceed 100 characters for UNIX sockets.

## Message Passing

Pass data between two MPI threads.
In this usage, MPI_Recv blocks waiting for MPI_Send

```sh
mpiexec -np 2 mpi/mpi_pass
```

## Notes

See
[OpenMPI docs](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#adding-ompi-to-path)
re: setting PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH if CMake has trouble finding OpenMPI for a compiler.

### Cray

FindMPI.cmake on Cray defines a rather sparse imported target MPI::MPI_C and MPI::MPI_Fortran like

```
-- Target: MPI::MPI_Fortran properties
-- MPI::MPI_Fortran IMPORTED = TRUE
-- MPI::MPI_Fortran NAME = MPI::MPI_Fortran
-- MPI::MPI_Fortran SYSTEM = ON
-- MPI::MPI_Fortran TYPE = INTERFACE_LIBRARY

-- Target: MPI::MPI_C properties
-- MPI::MPI_C IMPORTED = TRUE
-- MPI::MPI_C NAME = MPI::MPI_C
-- MPI::MPI_C SYSTEM = ON
-- MPI::MPI_C TYPE = INTERFACE_LIBRARY
```

while on most non-Cray platforms the typical properties are also defined: INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES, INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS.
Also on Cray. these typically defined variables are empty: MPI_Fortran_LIBRARIES, MPI_Fortran_MODULE_DIR, MPI_Fortran_INCLUDE_DIRS, MPI_Fortran_COMPILE_OPTIONS, MPI_Fortran_LINK_FLAGS.

### MPI-3 Fortran

If "mpi_f08.mod" is not found, typically the MPI include directories are also missing.
You can manually check if mpi_f08.mod is preset under the include "-I" directories from:

```sh
mpif90 -show
```
